He was one of 15 siblings, eight of whom died before the Partition of India. He was orphaned during the Partition when his parents, a brother and two sisters were killed in the violence that ensued between the villagers and Muslims who tried to convert them. He witnessed these killings.[3][7][8][9]

Escaping the troubles in Punjab, where killings of Hindus and Sikhs were continuing,[8] by moving to Delhi, India, in 1947, Singh lived for a short time with the family of his married sister[7] and was briefly imprisoned at Tihar jail for travelling on a train without a ticket. His sister, Ishvar, sold some jewellery to obtain his release.[9][10] He spent some time at a refugee camp in Purana Qila and at a resettlement colony in Shahdara, both in Delhi.[7]

Singh became disenchanted with his life and considered becoming a dacoit[b] but was instead persuaded by one of his brothers, Malkhan, to attempt recruitment to the Indian Army. He successfully gained entrance on his fourth attempt, in 1951, and while stationed at the Electrical Mechanical Engineering Centre[11] in Secunderabad and he was introduced to athletics. He had run the 10 km distance to and from school as a child and was selected by the army for special training in athletics after finishing sixth in a compulsory cross-country run for new recruits.[8][9] Singh has acknowledged how the army introduced him to sport, saying that "I came from a remote village, I didn't know what running was, or the Olympics"
